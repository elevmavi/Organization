# Organization
Creation of a program with Java. You can see four classes Member, Subscription, Department and Schedule.
The Member class stores the details of members and their subscriptions.
The Subscription class manages members' subscription packages, e.g. how many visits are left.
The Department class represents each department (eg Swimming Pool, CrossFit) with its schedule.
The Schedule class manages the schedule days and times and stores the participants for each specific day and time.
With this program you can manage members, their subscriptions, and their registrations in the departments. You can further extend it for more functionality such as changes to reservations or occupancy control.
